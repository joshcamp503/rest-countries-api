Just finished:
  Using useContext, useReducer, and custom fetch hook to set state with data from API

To do: 

  Implement state reset function that fires before filterCountries                                                                   
  
  Complete Search component:
    Create handleSubmit functionality that will filter/re-render countries based on form input

  Create CountryDetails component
    Make country-cards into clickable links 
    Create and style CountryDetails component content
    Add functionality (back button, etc)

  Add dark/light mode functionality using useContext(?)... re-watch Net Ninja tutorial for this
